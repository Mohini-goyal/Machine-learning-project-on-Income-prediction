# Machine-learning-project-on-Income-predictionOverview:

The income level prediction project entails rigorous preprocessing steps, addressing missing values and outliers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides crucial insights into the dataset's features. Subsequently, label encoding and feature scaling techniques are employed for data preparation. Three classification algorithms – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – are assessed. Notably, Random Forest exhibits superior performance, showcasing higher accuracy and lower error rates compared to Logistic Regression and KNN. Thus, Random Forest emerges as the preferred model for predicting income levels, offering robust predictive capabilities and ensuring reliable generalization on unseen data.
